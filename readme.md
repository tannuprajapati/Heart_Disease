# Heart Disease Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning models. It leverages data analysis, visualization, and classification algorithms to help identify patterns and insights that contribute to heart disease.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The goal is to develop a predictive model that can determine whether a patient has heart disease based on various medical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, etc.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains patient records with the following features (examples):
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Serum cholesterol
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Exercise induced angina
- Oldpeak (ST depression)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia
- Target (1: heart disease, 0: no heart disease)

## 🔍 Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Encoding categorical variables
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Statistical analysis
   - Correlation heatmaps
   - Histograms and distribution plots

3. **Model Building**:
   - Splitting the data into training and test sets
   - Applying classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM)
   - Evaluating model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

4. **Results**:
   - Visualizations of feature importance
   - Model evaluation metrics
